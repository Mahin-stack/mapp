<h1>  React-Native is language which was disovered by the coders of FaceBook.
It is an Amazing language.It is very easy and much similar to HTML language.
The only difference between them is that the letters are in capital in  React
Native where as in Html it has no capital letters.

So finally I conclude that it is a very innovative language and I am eager to learn it...
